    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Shevon Denny, I was born in the Amazon jungle of Guyana and immigrated to New York at a very young age with my family. I briefly studied Business Management in college then taught myself how to sew. Since then I’ve been creating custom garments for women and expressing myself through clothes. I’ve always had a passion for fashion and I hope to one day work as a Software Engineer at a fashion company. As I embark on my new journey into software engineering, I’m looking forward to the challenge and mostly the growth!</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>On my free time I enjoy sewing, reading, listening to music and going to the gym. During quarentine I picked up a new obsession, PLANTS! At the moment plants bring me the most joy. It’s symbolic to me because of the growth and how resilient some plants can be. It has helped to keep me focused on my future goals and I relate it to my journey into becoming a Software Engineer. I know it will take time, patience and nuturing in order for me to grow.</p>
